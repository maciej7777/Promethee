# Promethee

Works in this project has stopped according to new version of XMCDA library. You can find new code of modules from that project in my [a PrometheeDiviz repository](https://github.com/maciej7777/PrometheeDiviz#prometheediviz) - new modules are written in Java and i am going to support both v2 and v3 inputs there.
